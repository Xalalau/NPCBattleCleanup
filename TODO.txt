- Barnacles cleanup isn't working properly
-- it looks like gibs are no longer being detected properly
-- it can happen (very rare): remove a gib that is being eaten by an alive barnacle = game crashes
- Rebels killed by striders are turned into ragdolls and don't get deleted
- Some combine helicoper pieces are created burning and don't get removed
